# My_Profile
# Intro.py â€“ My First Python Script

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome!

This is a simple Python script that introduces who I am, what I'm currently learning, and where I aim to go professionally. I created this as my first GitHub project to demonstrate basic Python knowledge and begin documenting my journey into finance and data.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does
- Prints a short self-introduction
- Lists my interests, skills, and projects
- Shows a random thought or principle that resonates with me

## ðŸ§  Why I Made This
As an MBA student specializing in finance, I'm learning to use Python for data analysis and automation. This script is a beginner-friendly way to:
- Practice Python basics (functions, lists, loops, imports)
- Create my first GitHub project
- Share a little bit about my background and goals

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run It
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python intro.py
